I'm a front-end developer looking for the opportunities to grow professionally. Having 2-year background in back-end and full-stack development I have a deep understanding of all the software development processes and how Agile projects are run.Every day I work on my skills in this direction and expanding them with new knowledge. Currently I'm working on project on NextJS and repeating foundations in RSschool. 

My plans are to learn ExpressJS. Often I solve katas on codewars.com. I value my own time very hight, that's why it's better for me to have a remote work. But I can consider an office job too, depends on opportunities that it could provide me with.
